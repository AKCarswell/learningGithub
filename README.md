# learningGithub

This is the readme file, place here things that you want anyone viewing your repository to see.
normally it would be instructions or rules that you set for its use.

in this case I would like you to simply create a file called <yourname>.txt
and in this file please enter your full name, do not add anything more as this repository is public
and you do not want to leave anything personal on here.
